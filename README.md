# tumbleweed
(in progress, teaching myself pygame)     
run by typing the following into terminal: 
cd tumble_my_weed
python3 tumble_my_weed.py   
start over screen has bugs rn    


I have a lot of global variables currently since the code is a script, but this will fixed in the next update.   
Planned updates:   1) fix game over screen  2) make background go from daytime to nighttime as game goes on   3) add a better jump animation
